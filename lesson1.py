# ## Conclusion
# 
# * 1.1 Data parsing - The data set is loaded from the repository, and some attributes are supplemented
# * 1.2 Data preprocessing and allocation of significant attributes - The data set is processed from empty values, and the most "important" attributes are determined by the Pearson correlation
# * 1.3 Description of the data set structure - for each attribute, a description and density of the data distribution are presented
# * 1.4 Formation of additional attributes - An additional Rt attribute has been formed, which determines the coefficient of infection spread over the last 8 days
